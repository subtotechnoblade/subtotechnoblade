### 🚀 Key Features & Innovations
*   ⚡ **High-Performance MCTS:** Optimized with implicit node trees (10x memory reduction) and Numba JIT (12.5% speedup).
*   🌐 **Distributed Inference:** Multi-worker self-play with a central inference server for 3x faster data generation.
*   🚀 **Efficient Deployment:** ONNX Runtime & TensorRT integration for ultra-low latency inference.
*   🎮 **Generalizable:** Applied to Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect4, and Gomoku.

### 🔮 Future Work
*   Exploring **Gumbel AlphaZero** for improved exploration.
*   Investigating **MuZero**-like capabilities for environments without a perfect simulator.

### 👥 Teamwork
*   Led a team of 6 to develop and integrate multiple game environments using Agile methodologies.
